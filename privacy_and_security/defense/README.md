# Assignment 3 - Mart Veldkamp

If inside folder, you can check the dependencies in re requirements.txt file. Or install them using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For every assignment, I've made a different python file (had some problems with variables). You can just run the file using (for isntance):

```bash
python problem_4.py
```
